# Cuidapet Back-end
 
## âœ¨ About

Cuidapet is a petshop hub app, in Portuguese, where the user can buy pet stuff and order it from the market. This project is in progress. While I'm already familiar with Golang and built an entire API with it, I wished to try Dart on back-end for study and tests purposes. It uses Get_it and Injectable as DI, Logger as server logs, mySql under Docker as database, Shelf and Shel_router for web serving and routes, respectively.
